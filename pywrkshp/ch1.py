## Ch.1 exercises from Python Workshop (Bird, Han et. al.)
## Although these are very basic, it would be a good idea for me to work on
##     my coding fundamentals, especially considering the looming prospect
##     of coding interviews.

## Addendum: the exercises provided for this chapter are effectively just
##     examples of the mechanics of Python's operatiosn and basic syntax.
##     Skipping ahead to exercises that are more substantial than just
##     typing out what's already provided. 5/6/21

## 5/11/21: Skipped ahead to Chapter 2

### Thank you for checking out my repository!

I'm currently searching for work and am putting together a few files and basic applications to serve as a code portfolio.

Quick solutions can be found with simple summaries in the "completed" folder within "challenges", and problems I'm working on (if any) will appear in "challenges" proper.

The "clrsalgs" folder is where I put python implementations of sorting algorithms and data structures described within Cormen et. al.'s _"Introduction to Algorithms"_.

The "poker" folder is a collection of files with which I hope to make a simple poker application and more thoroughly understand the life cycle of a program. Everything inside is obviously a work in progress (or, if you don't want to sugar-coat it, barebones as all hell).

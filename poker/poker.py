## notes to self for implementation:
# round counter, player status, side pots, player bet, database check for hands,
# hand calculation, probability of winning calculation, hand sorts (suit, rank)
#
# remember that hand calculation must take all combinations of the player's hand
# and the drawn cards and return the best of them
#
# player status check must include side-bets (player has gone all-in but others
# still have money for remaining rounds)
#
# as such, the game should have a global check to see if all active players have
# gone all-in, as well as when all players have been knocked payout
#
# include a case for hand comparison that splits pot between hands of equal value
